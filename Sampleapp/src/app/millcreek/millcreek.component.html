      Millcreek Canyon has a beautiful river carving through it. But this was by
      far the hardest river I have ever fished.

      This was very technical fishing. Only had room for bow and arrow casting.
      I was hoping to catch a Westslope Cutthroat trout.

      I only interacted with 2 fish all day. I casted to one I could see for
      around 45 minutes but I never caught it.

      The other trout I interacted with at a different location did take my fly
      but I lost him and he never took another fly I sent his way.
