        The Left Fork of the Blacksmiths Fork was a gorgeous small stream. I
        caught 2 fish on it but had several more bites.

        From what I can tell this is my first cutthroat trout. I think it is
        either a Westslope or Bonneville

        The trout here like to hide under the brush on the banks. It makes
        tangles more likely if you keep your flies close to the banks and brush
        but if you want to catch fish sometimes you have to take risks.
