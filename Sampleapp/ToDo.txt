- app crashes at failed insert
- Add ssl to the project link
- Make github repo private without affecting the automatic build in aws
- add database
    - table for user login info DONE
    - table for comments
- header and footer components
- hide peoples passwords somehow from myself
- need to check and make sure the username doesnt already exist in the database (need to add something in UI to tell user about this)
