- make the app mobile - friendly (small screen hamburger)

(darren advice)
- You need to rezide the images to make them smaller.  For example the one with the fish in the net is 4.24MB and 3024x4032 pixels.  
You should rezide them down to < 1000 x 1000px.  That should make them around 100k which will make them download a lot faster.
- You might also want to strip out the Meta Data in the images so people can see it.  
For example I can see that you took the pictures on a Samsung Galaxy S10e phone on June 11th, 2021 2:21pm
