- app crashes at failed insert
- Add ssl to the project link
- why do I have the localhost:8080 error popup when I insert an account??
- Make github repo private without affecting the automatic build in aws
- add database
    - table for user login info
    - table for comments
- header and footer components
- hide peoples passwords somehow from myself
- need to clear out the field contents when they submit the from
- need to check and make sure the username doesnt already exist in the database
- add some type of automated test that clicks all the buttons (finc test?)


(darren advice)
- You might also want to strip out the Meta Data in the images so people can see it.  
For example I can see that you took the pictures on a Samsung Galaxy S10e phone on June 11th, 2021 2:21pm
